## Philosophy

EXODUS is built on the belief that tattooing is one of humanity's oldest art forms. The name references the journey — both the physical travels that shaped Pierre Marcel's craft and the transformative journey each client undertakes when they choose to carry sacred marks. The studio's philosophy page traces the history of body art from 5,300-year-old Ötzi the Iceman through Polynesian tā moko, Japanese irezumi, Amazonian tribal traditions, and African scarification — connecting contemporary blackwork to its ancestral roots.
